<h2>Firefighters need a vehicle that could get them to places safe and quick.
  The truck could harry many different things depending on what truck it is.
There are different types of trucks but the main are the ones that have an E or a
 T on the side. Those letters identify what type of vehicle it is. The E stands for Engine. The engines carry gallons of water
 and everything that is needed for a car or structure fire. The T stands for truck. The trucks carry water but not as much as
 the engines. The trucks are the ones that have the ladder and the equipment.
