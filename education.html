<h2>Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) provide out of hospital emergency medical care and transportation for critical and emergent
 patients who access the emergency medical services (EMS) system. EMTs have the basic knowledge and skills necessary to
 stabilize and safely transport patients ranging from non-emergency and routine medical transports to life threatening
 emergencies. Emergency Medical Technicians function as part of a comprehensive EMS response system, under medical oversight.
 Emergency Medical Technicians assess, decide and perform patient interventions with the basic equipment typically found on
  an ambulance. Emergency Medical Technicians are a critical link between the scene of an emergency and the health care system.</h2>
